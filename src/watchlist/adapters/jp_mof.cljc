(ns watchlist.adapters.jp-mof
  "Japan Ministry of Finance 資産凍結等対象者一覧 (consolidated asset-freeze
   target list) CSV -> watchlist.model entities.

   Schema verified against the actual live file fetched during this ns's
   development -- https://www.mof.go.jp/policy/international_policy/
   gaitame_kawase/gaitame/economic_sanctions/shisantouketsu20260820.csv,
   UTF-8 with a BOM, 32 columns, 2,866 rows -- not reconstructed from
   memory. See test/fixtures/jp_mof_sample.csv for a schema-faithful
   fixture (real header row, fabricated names).

   WHY THIS SOURCE. The MOF list is the only one of the three this repo
   ingests that is published under Japanese law (外為法 / the Foreign
   Exchange and Foreign Trade Act) and the only one that carries Japanese
   orthography for its subjects. It is NOT a 反社会的勢力 (organised-crime)
   database: no such list is published in machine-readable form by any
   Japanese authority, and this repository must not be described as
   screening for one. It is an asset-freeze / economic-sanctions list, the
   same subject as OFAC SDN and the UN Consolidated List.

   THE URL MOVES. MOF encodes the publication date in the filename
   (shisantouketsu<YYYYMMDD>.csv) and does not keep a stable alias, so a
   hardcoded URL either 404s or -- worse -- keeps serving one frozen
   snapshot forever while every refresh reports success. `latest-csv-link`
   reads the index page and finds the newest one; it is pure so it can be
   tested, and the fetching stays in scripts/refresh_lists.cljs."
