  "Name-matching for sanctions/PEP screening — pure functions, no I/O.

   HONESTY NOTE (do not remove): matching a query name against a watchlist
   entity by string similarity is a real, hard problem commercial vendors
   (ComplyAdvantage, Refinitiv World-Check, Dow Jones) spend significant
   ongoing effort tuning. A naive exact-string match has a very high
   false-negative rate (misses real matches from transliteration variants,
   e.g. Arabic/Cyrillic romanization drift, that never look like an exact
   or even Jaro-Winkler-close string). This ns's tiered scoring is a real,
   deterministic, tested algorithm — not a black box — but its bounds are
   explicit and narrower than a production compliance vendor's: anything
   below `low-threshold` is NOT surfaced as a candidate at all. Treat that
   as a documented false-negative risk (README.md), not an implementation
   detail to hide."

;; --- script folding -------------------------------------------------------
;; Added 2026-08-26, when :jp-mof brought the first non-Latin names into the
;; index. Until then `normalize`'s [a-z0-9 ] filter was total by accident:
;; every indexed name was Latin, so nothing ever asked what a Japanese name
;; normalizes TO. It answered "" -- and that answer is not merely useless,
;; it is unsafe. `jaro-winkler` of two empty strings is 1.0, so the moment
;; ONE indexed name normalized to empty, EVERY query that also normalized to
;; empty scored :fuzzy-high against it. Measured on the commit before this
;; one: (score-name "山田太郎" "アル・カーイダ") returned
;; {:tier :fuzzy-high :confidence 0.92} -- two unrelated names, reported as
;; a sanctions hit. The fix is two-sided, and both halves are load-bearing:
;; fold the scripts so real Japanese names survive normalization, AND floor
;; `score-name` so a name that STILL cannot be represented matches nothing.

   turns an unrepresentable name into 'no candidate' instead of into a
   1.0 self-match:
     - Latin diacritic stripping (portable .cljc has no Unicode normalizer
       without a dependency) -- the pre-existing gap, unchanged.
     - kanji <-> kana reading: 山田 and ヤマダ are the same name and this
       returns different strings for them. That needs a reading dictionary,
