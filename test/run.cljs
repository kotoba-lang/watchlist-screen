;; run.cljs — the ClojureScript half of this repo's suite, under nbb.
;;
;;   nbb -cp "test:$(clojure -Spath)" test/run.cljs
;;
;; `test` FIRST, not appended. Measured 2026-08-26: with `test` at the end of
;; the classpath nbb reports "Could not find namespace: watchlist.match-test"
;; for every namespace under test/, and with `test` at the front it finds all
;; of them -- same files, same entries, different order. The mechanism is not
;; established here, and the reason is not written down as if it were; what is
;; established is that the working order is this one, and that the failure
;; reads like a missing file rather than like a classpath problem.
;;
;; WHY THIS EXISTS. Every namespace it covers is .cljc and every one of them
;; is executed under nbb in production by scripts/refresh_lists.cljs. Running
;; them only on the JVM tested one of the two runtimes they run on, and that
;; is not hypothetical: a `(int c)` in watchlist.match returns the code unit
;; on the JVM and 0 in ClojureScript, so the script folds were no-ops under
;; nbb -- (normalize "ｱﾙ･ｶｰｲﾀﾞ") silently dropped the voiced ﾀﾞ -- while the
;; JVM suite stayed green. See watchlist.match/char-code.
;;
;; NOT COVERED, and stated rather than omitted: watchlist.adapters.edn-index
;; is deliberately .clj (clojure.java.io), so watchlist.adapters.edn-index-test
;; is JVM-only by design. Everything else in test/ is here. If you add a .cljc
;; test namespace, add it to BOTH this vector and nothing else -- the JVM
;; runner discovers namespaces itself, so only this side can fall behind.
